# Rubric

## Deployment
Performing - App is deployed to gh-pages and is congruent to what's happening in the master branch locally.

## Technical Requirements
Performing/Excelling - There are lots of great abstractions! The code is well written and semantic. Its definitely moving in the right direction towards object oriented design. Take what you've done with this code base, and see how you can apply JS classes.

## Code Quality
Excelling/Performing - Really great commenting. Your code is very clear as to what it's doing as a result. Code is well formatted and like the above comments state, well abstracted.

## Creativity/Interface
Excelling - The halloween theme was really cool! The app is just really well polished, very nice work. One minor gripe is the page refresh on resetting the game, I'm all about dat SPA (single page application) life.
